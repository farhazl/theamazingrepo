  <h2> Emma </h2>
  <p id="Emma"> I was born in Vancouver on April 14th 1995. When I was 11, my family moved to Cowichan Bay on Vancouver Island. I have BA from the University of Victoria and I hope to get a job in UX/UI Design when I have completed the D3 program. I love food, shopping, makeup, hiking, video games, and animals. My favourite colours are purple and green. </p>
